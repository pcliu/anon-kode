# Progress

## What Works

*   **Core CLI Functionality:** The `kode` command exists and can be installed globally (`npm install -g anon-kode`).
*   **AI Model Integration:** Supports connecting to OpenAI-style API endpoints.
*   **Configuration:** Users can configure models via `/model` and `/config` commands.
*   **Basic Commands:** Includes commands for onboarding, model selection, configuration, and bug reporting (`/bug`).
*   **MCP Server Mode:** Can function as an MCP server for integration with tools like Claude Desktop.
*   **Development Workflow:** Basic build (`pnpm run build`) and development (`pnpm run dev`) scripts are functional.
*   **Code Formatting:** Prettier is set up for code formatting.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Testing:** No automated test suite seems to be configured or mentioned.
*   **Advanced Features:** Specific capabilities mentioned in the description (fixing spaghetti code, explaining functions, running tests) depend on the underlying AI model's capabilities and the implementation of specific tools/commands leveraging those models, which are not fully detailed in the README/package.json alone. Further code analysis would be needed to assess the implementation status of these features.
*   **Documentation:** While a README exists, more detailed documentation on specific commands, tool usage, and advanced configuration might be needed.
*   **Error Handling:** Robustness and specific error handling scenarios are not detailed.

## Current Status

*   **Version:** 0.0.53 (as per `package.json`)
*   **State:** Functional alpha/beta stage. Core setup is complete, allowing users to install and connect to AI models. Ready for basic usage and development contribution.
*   **Distribution:** Available via npm.

## Known Issues

*   No specific issues listed in the provided context, but the README includes a "Use at own risk" warning, suggesting potential instability or bugs.
*   The `/bug` command facilitates reporting issues to GitHub.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial focus on creating a terminal-based AI assistant.
*   Decision to support any OpenAI-style API for flexibility.
*   Addition of MCP server capability for broader integration.
*   Choice of Ink for interactive terminal UI.
*   Use of pnpm for package management and bun for building.
